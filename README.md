Hiding in plain sight.

Ultraviolet is an intuitively light-weight and simple to use steganography application, made during the 48 hour PennApps hackathon in February 2014. 

Steganography is the art of concealing a message within an image in a virtually unnoticeable fashion, only to be revealed by those who are aware of the message's existence.

Download Ultraviolet today, and conceal all your secrets behind the veil of an image.
